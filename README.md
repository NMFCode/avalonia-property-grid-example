# Avalonia PropertyView and TreeEditor example

This repository demonstrates how to use the controls PropertyView and TreeEditor in action. It is based on a simple Avalonia template.

## PropertyView

The `PropertyView` control displays the properties of a model element. The control understands the structure of NMF models and shows editors appropriately. Bind the object thats properties are shown using a data binding to the `DataContext` property.

## TreeEditor

The `TreeEditor` control shows a containment tree of a model. It supports data binding of the root element and selected item.
